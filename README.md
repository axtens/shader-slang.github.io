Slang is a language for real-time graphics programming that extends HLSL with new capabilities for modular, extensible, and high-performance programming.

# Why Slang?

Real-time graphics developers need tools that help them achieve the highest possible performance on a variety of hardware platforms and GPU APIs while also managing the complexity of large and evolving GPU codebases. Slang has been designed and implemented based on these needs:

* Compatibility: The Slang language is backwards compatible with most existing HLSL, so you don't need to rewrite your code. The Slang compiler can generate code for D3D12, Vulkan, D3D11, CUDA, and CPU, with more targets on the way.

* Modular and Extensible Graphics Code: The extensions that Slang adds to HLSL support cleaner and more modular shader code, allowing developers to confidently scale up their codebases to support ray tracing and other new real-time graphics techniques.

* Performance: Slang is first and foremost a GPU language, and its new features have been carefully implemented so that they do not compromise on the runtime performance of generated code.
